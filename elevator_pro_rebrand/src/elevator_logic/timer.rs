//! Timer module for managing asynchronous timeouts in elevator control logic.
//!
//! This module defines a `Timer` struct that can be used to measure elapsed time and
//! detect timeouts in a non-blocking, asynchronous context. It supports both
//! *soft timeouts* based on elapsed wall time and *hard timeouts* that can be triggered manually.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The timer is typically used in logic that requires tracking operation durations,
//! such as keeping elevator doors open for a fixed time, or detecting communication timeouts.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use elevator_logic::request::{choose_direction, should_stop};
//! use world_view::{ElevatorContainer, Dirn};
//! 
//! let direction_and_behaviour = choose_direction(&elevator);
//! if should_stop(&elevator) {
//!     // Open doors, reset timers
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Behaviour
//!
//! - A timer is *inactive* until `timer_start()` is called.
//! - When active, the timer checks elapsed time using `Instant`.
//! - The timer can be *manually forced* to timeout using `release_timer()`.
//! - `timer_timeouted()` returns `true` if either the soft or hard timeout has occurred.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - `Timer` struct stores state (active, elapsed, hard timeout flag).
//! - Methods include:
//!     - `timer_start()` to activate and reset timer.
//!     - `release_timer()` to force a timeout.
//!     - `get_wall_time()` to check elapsed time.
//!     - `timer_timeouted()` to evaluate timeout status.
