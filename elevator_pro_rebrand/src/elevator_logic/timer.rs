//! Timer module for managing asynchronous timeouts in elevator control logic.
//!
//! This module defines two core components:
//! - [`Timer`]: A general-purpose timer that supports both soft (elapsed time) and hard (manual) timeouts.
//! - [`ElevatorTimers`]: A struct that bundles all timers used in the elevator FSM, including door timeout,
//!   cab call priority grace period, and general error detection.
//!
//! These components are used throughout the elevator state machine to control behavior based on timeouts,
//! such as how long to keep doors open, how long to prioritize internal cab calls, or when to enter an error state
//! due to inactivity or unresponsiveness.
//!
//! # Usage
//! Timers are used in `fsm.rs` to manage:
//! - Door open duration (`door` timer)
//! - Grace period for cab button prioritization (`cab_priority` timer)
//! - Communication or logic errors (`error` timer)
//!
//! # Example (using Timer standalone)
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use tokio::time::Duration;
//! use crate::elevator_logic::timer::Timer;
//!
//! let mut door_timer = Timer::new(Duration::from_secs(3));
//! door_timer.timer_start();
//!
//! // In FSM loop:
//! if door_timer.timer_timeouted() {
//!     // Trigger door close logic
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # ElevatorTimers Usage
//! ElevatorTimers simplifies timer management by grouping all related timers into one struct:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! let mut timers = ElevatorTimers::new(
//!     Duration::from_secs(3),   // door
//!     Duration::from_secs(10),  // cab priority
//!     Duration::from_secs(7),   // error
//! );
//!
//! timers.door.timer_start();
//! if timers.cab_priority.timer_timeouted() {
//!     // Prioritization window over
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Timer Behavior
//! - A timer is **inactive** until [`timer_start()`](Timer::timer_start) is called.
//! - Once active, it compares current time with the internal start time.
//! - The timer can be **manually forced** to timeout using [`release_timer()`](Timer::release_timer).
//! - A call to [`timer_timeouted()`](Timer::timer_timeouted) returns `true` if either a soft or hard timeout has occurred.
//!
//! # Related
//! Used heavily in the [`fsm`](crate::elevator_logic::fsm) module.
