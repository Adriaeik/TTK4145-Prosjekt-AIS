- Excellent use of Tokio and asynchronous Rust features, significantly improving potential scalability and concurrency compared to synchronous threading approaches.
- The code has a clear modular structure with clearly defined modules (`network`, `world_view`, `elevator_logic`, `utils`, etc.), aiding readability and maintainability.
- Initialization logic (`init.rs`) is well-documented and clear, but the panic on network failure ("No internet connection on start-up will result in a panic!") could instead return an error and handle it gracefully to improve robustness.
- Good use of Rust idioms (`Option`, `Result`, `Atomic`) throughout, but there is excessive usage of unsafe global mutable state (`config.rs`), creating risks for potential data races and making debugging more challenging.
- Utility functions in `utils.rs` provide helpful abstraction and error logging; however, the presence of informal or overly playful comments (e.g., "Cosmic rays flipped a bit!") slightly undermines code professionalism and readability.
- The FSM and task allocation logic (`task_allocater.rs`) is clean and structured but contains incomplete implementations and placeholder comments (e.g., "Denne delen av prosjektet er 'ikke p√•begynt'"), indicating the codebase needs further development for reliability.
- Networking logic (`udp_broadcast.rs`, `tcp_network.rs`) appears robust, with clear message handling and task spawning. Yet, abrupt termination or panic in scenarios such as network failures should be replaced with proper error propagation and recovery logic to increase resilience in real-world deployments.
