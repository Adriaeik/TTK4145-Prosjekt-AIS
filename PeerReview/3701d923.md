- Good use of asynchronous programming patterns with `tokio`, which supports concurrent handling of tasks clearly and efficiently.
- Effective use of `Arc`, `RwLock`, and `Mutex` demonstrates thoughtful consideration of thread safety and concurrent data management, though extensive use of locks might lead to performance bottlenecks or potential deadlocks in more complex scenarios.
- Consistent application of Rust features such as `Lazy` initialization (`once_cell`) and environment variable handling enhances flexibility, but the extensive reliance on environment variables could complicate debugging or setup for new users.
- Code readability is generally good due to meaningful naming conventions; however, certain function names or module paths (`data`, `utils`) remain vague and could be improved for quicker understanding.
- Comments are present but overly informal at times, mixing humorous or casual language (e.g., "Killing myself... ReeeEEEEeeee!") with technical explanations. More professional and concise commenting could enhance clarity(JK).
- The handling of network disconnection (`network_status`) is clear, yet abruptly terminating the application (`std::process::exit(1)`) might not be ideal for robustness or recovery in real-world scenarios.
- Configuration handling via environment variables (`ELEVATOR_NETWORK_ID`, `NUMBER_FLOORS`) is functional but lacks clear error-handling or informative fallback procedures for incorrect inputs or missing configurations, potentially causing runtime errors.
