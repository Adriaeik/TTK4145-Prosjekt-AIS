- Good modular structure, clear separation of responsibilities across modules (`networking`, `single_elevator`, etc.), which helps readability and maintainability.
- The FSM logic (`single_elevator/fsm.rs`) is generally understandable but contains repeated code segments, suggesting potential improvements by abstracting into helper functions.
- The project does not utilize asynchronous Rust frameworks such as Tokio. Incorporating async/await patterns could significantly improve scalability and better utilize CPU resources, especially if the system is expanded to handle more elevators or higher message throughput.
- Error handling usually follows Rust idioms (`Result`, `Option`), yet several `.unwrap()` calls appear without clear justification or handling, increasing the risk of unexpected panics at runtime.
- Documentation within modules is inconsistent; critical functionality, particularly within network handling (`networking.rs`) and FSM logic, lacks sufficient explanation or clear reasoning behind design choices.
- Configuration parameters such as `NUM_BUTTONS` and other constants are spread across different files, which complicates maintainability; centralizing these constants would simplify updates and adjustments.
- The networking implementation (`networking.rs`) is functional but relies on abrupt termination (`process::exit(1)`) upon encountering errors. More robust error handling or recovery strategies would greatly improve reliability in practical deployments.
