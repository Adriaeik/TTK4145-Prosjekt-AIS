- The project's concurrency structure using `crossbeam_channel` is functional and straightforward, but the decision not to use an asynchronous runtime like Tokio is a significant missed opportunity. Using Tokioâ€™s asynchronous runtime would considerably improve scalability, CPU utilization, and responsiveness, especially if the project grows in complexity or elevator count.
- The FSM implementation (`fsm.rs`) shows good use of Rust enums and state management patterns, though some logic is duplicated or verbose, such as repeated match patterns, indicating possibilities for simplification through more abstraction or helper methods.
- Overall, the system's concurrency model with threads and channels is clear, but the use of synchronous `std::thread::sleep()` for timing (`alarm.rs`, `fsm.rs`) limits scalability. Transitioning to asynchronous timers would greatly improve responsiveness and resource usage.
- Error handling is inconsistent and somewhat unsafe; several `.unwrap()` statements in critical network operations (e.g., in `sender.rs`, `receiver.rs`, and `network.rs`) risk panics without proper context or recovery strategies, reducing reliability significantly.
- The project structure is clear, and code modularity is good (`manager.rs`, `controller.rs`, etc.), facilitating ease of navigation and maintainability. However, some critical functionality (e.g., handling network state synchronization) lacks sufficient explanatory comments, hindering quick understanding of intent or reasoning.
- Good adherence to Rust conventions overall, but better encapsulation and stricter management of shared state could improve maintainability. For example, mutable shared state (like the elevator `WorldView` structure) could be better protected or refactored to reduce potential race conditions or complexity.
- Magic numbers are partly mitigated through a centralized configuration file (`config.rs`), yet certain timeouts or configuration parameters scattered in multiple modules remain hard-coded and should be consolidated to improve maintainability and clarity.
